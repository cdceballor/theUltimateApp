escape: When we return HTML code, any user can inject code by js, like an alert or something like that
escape helps us to fix this kind of things, for example, when we receive an alert in the url, escape convert the alert in handle text,

The canonical URL for the projects endpoint has a trailing slash. It’s similar to a folder in a file system. If you access the
URL without a trailing slash (/projects), Flask redirects you to the canonical URL with the trailing slash (/projects/).

The canonical URL for the about endpoint does not have a trailing slash. It’s similar to the pathname of a file.
Accessing the URL with a trailing slash (/about/) produces a 404 “Not Found” error. This helps keep URLs
unique for these resources, which helps search engines avoid indexing the same page twice.
